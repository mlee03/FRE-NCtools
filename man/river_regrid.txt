NAME
----

river_regrid - remap river network from a global regular lat-lon to another grid

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
river_regrid --mosaic _mosaic_grid_ --river_src _river_src_file_ [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

river_regrid will remap river network data from global regular lat-lon
grid onto any other grid (includes regular lat-lon grid and cubic
grid), which is specified through option *--mosaic*. The river network
source data is specified through option *--river_src*.

OPTIONS
-------

*--mosaic* _mosaic_grid_::

Specify the mosaic file of destination grid. This mosaic file should
be a coupler mosaic file, which contains link to land solo mosaic and
the exchange grid file.

*--river_src* _river_src_file_::

specify the river network source data file. The data is assumed on
regular lat-lon grid and the longitude is assumed from 0 to 360 degree
and latitude is assumed from -90 to 90 degree.

*--output* _output_file_::

specify the output file base name. the suffix '.nc' should not be
included in the output_file. The default value is river_output. For
one tile mosaic, the actual result will be $output_file.nc. For
multiple tile mosaic, the result will be _$output.tile#.nc_.

*--land_thresh* _land_thresh_::

Any grid cell with land fraction greater than 1-land_thresh will have
land fraction = 1. Default value is 0.


*--min_frac* _min_frac_::

Any grid cell with land fraction less than min_frac will
have land fraction = 0.

*--read_land_mask*::

Read the land fraction from file land_mask.tile#.nc if
it is specified. If not, read the exchange grid and
compute the land fraction. It is recommended to set this
option when atmosphere grid is a nested grid.

EXAMPLES
--------

Regrid the river network in the river_network_mrg_0.5deg_ad3nov_0.nc
file on the the grid specified by the grid_spec.nc file.

----
$ river_regrid --mosaic grid_spec.nc --river_srr \
  river_network_mrg_0.5deg_ad3nov_0.125.nc --land_thresh 1.e-4 \
  --min_frac 0
